# COMP345

This repo contains my code for the assignments

## To build

```bash

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

```

## To run
```bash 
./SmallWorld
```

## Documentation
* After building there will be a doc directory in the build directory (`build/doc`). 
* It is automatically generated with Doxygen which can be read by opening `build/doc/html/index.html` with a browser.
* In the `build/TestData` directory, there are map files as well as viz files. The viz files can be used with GraphViz to visualize the map files.


#NOTES FOR ASSIGNMENT 2
I didn't manage to finish it due to my course load.
Also there are design decisions that I thought would 
work well at the beginning but at this point they might
be hindering my progress. Also some of these parts were 
done in a panic, trying to complete as much in the little
bit of time I could afford to put into this specific assignment.
Reason why this is a highly coupled mess...
